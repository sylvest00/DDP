## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to:
- Create a deck using Slidify
- Include an interactive plot generated by plotly and hosted on plot.ly
- Share the deck using either Rpubs, GitPages, or Neocities

## Code to Generate Figure
I chose to use the R data set "EuStockMarkets" which contains daily closing prices of stock markets in Europe. To generate the plotly figure, the code below was created. The figure was published on plot.ly via the plotly_POST command.
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
data("EuStockMarkets")
df <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets)
df$time = 1:dim(df)[1]
xlab <- list(title = 'Time (Number of Days)')
ylab <- list(title = 'Closing Price')
p <- plot_ly(data = df, x = ~time, y = ~DAX,
             type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', name = 'DAX') %>%
    add_trace(y = ~SMI, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', name = 'SMI') %>%
    add_trace(y = ~CAC, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', name = 'CAC') %>%
    add_trace(y = ~FTSE, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', name = 'FTSE') %>%
    layout(xaxis = xlab, yaxis = ylab)
```
